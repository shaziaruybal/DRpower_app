# Source code for the DRpower app: *pfhrp2/3* Planner

This tool is designed to help researchers conducting *Plasmodium falciparum hrp2/3* gene deletion studies. It can be used in two ways:

1. In the design phase (before data have been collected) to help guide the appropriate number of clusters and a sample size per cluster.
2. In the analysis phase (once data are available) to estimate prevalence of deletions and determine if they are above a set threshold.

The Shiny application uses the DRpower R package (https://mrc-ide.github.io/DRpower) in the back-end for simulations.

## Accessing the web application
The DRpower app is available as an easy-to-use web application at https://shiny.dide.ic.ac.uk/DRpower-app.

## The DRpower package
